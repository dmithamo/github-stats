# GitHub Stats

## Intro

This application consumes the GitHub API.
Currently, it can:

- query the API for a GitHub user given a username
- query the API for a GitHub user's repos (public) given the user's username

## The Objective

...is to master React while learning Typescript. Also I enjoy this kinda stuff so, yea - to have fun is an equally important objective, if not importanter.
